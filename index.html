						When it comes to accurately tracking physiological symptoms Plume’s wearable sensors allow for regular daily monitoring in a comfortable and comprehensive way. A sensor worn at the hip measures step count, length, instances of freezing as well as falls; a second sensor worn on the wrist measures upper body tremors; a third sensor worn on the wrist measures blood pressure when stationary.

							  	<p>3. The sensor will need to be worn as directed by your physician. For example, your doctor may recommend you record your blood pressure only in the morning immediately after you wake up.</p>
